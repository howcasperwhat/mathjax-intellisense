However, plain text or LaTeX formulas can be hard to read. The MathJax IntelliSense extension suite was created to improve formula readability and streamline this process.</p><h2 id="introduction" tabindex="-1">Introduction <a class="header-anchor" href="#introduction" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Introduction&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Initially, the plugin was named <a href="/extensions/comment-formula.html">Comment Formula</a> as its original goal was to provide formula rendering exclusively within comments for the Python language. However, as similar needs arose for other programming languages, it became evident that the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/580" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">VSCode API</a> could not reliably determine whether a formula was inside a comment. As a result, the plugin evolved into a unified, language-agnostic, and highly customizable formula preview tool that captures formulas globally across source code.</p><p>Later, it became apparent that formula parsing in many languages, such as C++ and C, required removing specific characters. The original approach would capture and render everything, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, the following formula would extract <code>E\\n/// = mc^2</code> and feed it into the <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">MathJax</a> parser, while the intended formula to render was <code>E = mc^2</code>. Since the extraction rules vary across languages and lack universal patterns, separate plugins had to be created for each language. Fortunately, with the help of the <a href="https://github.com/vsce-toolroom/vscode-textmate-languageservice" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">vscode-textmate-languageservice</a> token parser, we can now accurately capture docstrings.</p><div class="language-cpp vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">cpp</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-light:#6A737D;--shiki-dark:#6A737D;">/// Formula: \\f$ E</span></span>
